What issues are important to them? What time? What can we change in the issues to be in our favor? The dynamics of a competitive competitive buying evaluation become volatile, often even the most experienced salespeople fail because they do the right thing at the wrong time. The issues change in relative importance over long sales cycle. Consequently, sales strategies should be time based depending on the phase or stage of the sales cycle. Some sales methods imply that should not be changed the history of strategy has proven this wrong in war, business and sales. The speed with which you can refine or revalidate a dynamic plan is the key to victory. By the time alongside is one you will probably be on Plan D E or F. What issues what causes things to become so topsy turvy in the crucible? The issues changes the client approaches the decision making phase of their selection process. If there is a tangible product involved, project teams feel they must analyze every technical aspect, looking for product fit against their requirements. But as they approach the decision making phase they have found that several vendors have adequate solutions the real issue that starts to arise is the one of risk. Risk rises As the client committee approaches a decision to purchase a solution, the difficulty of the post sale implementation begins to rise as an issue going into install this How are we going to implement it successfully fully? What processes must be changed along with the new product? How do we change the workflows compensation performance requirements and communication? Successful solution as the buyers approach the decision making phase, issues can begin to shift off product features or solution fit onto implementation risk issues such as service financial stability, responsiveness, preferences, terms and conditions on the contract, such as penalty clauses guaranteed warranties, delivery dates and liquidated damages. But the bad news is that at this point, the client is asking you all sorts of nasty snarling legal questions. The good news is that the client is asking you these nasty styling legal questions. If after your capabilities presentation they are not asking you risk questions. They're not thinking about doing business at this point in the server time, it's probably talking to one vendor about implementations and contracts and keeping the other two in the dark, but not tend to go away. Those vendors and columns B and C are getting out of control signals or silence or quite possibly the deal is not happening at all. Price is resurrected. The other issue that starts to arise after the decision making process is price. In the early phase of an evaluation, if you ask the client, how important is the price to your deliberations quite often you get the answer like not very or we want the best solution. In the middle of their evaluation phase they are preoccupied with functionality and requirements and capabilities but at the end it always comes back to price. The client after their decision on a certain vendor is now into their last phase called acquisition and a new set of games begin. Commodification and negotiation It usually start something like this several firms can meet their needs but your price is higher. What can you do about that? They all look alike to us. We can't tell the difference between any of them. This is called convenient amnesia. It's a game buyers play after six months of studying the differences between the competing solutions. They now suddenly go blank and focus on price. Is it really because the money? No, it's a sport. And if you can't pull out a list of differentiating advantages then you're going unarmed into a battle of wits. If at that point, you can't document your value proposition. You'll end up being commodified or discounting or maybe losing altogether. Where do these differentiating advantages come from? All the way back to the needs assessment or the requirements definition in the first place. That's where you understand, understood the client's needs and where you found out if you had an advantage if you qualified and if you headed into negotiation you better take these items with you to document value The count is marginally profitable, it may actually increase it. If it goes poorly no one will say Well at least we got a bargain. never go to purchasing or legal alone. Remember, these people would buy a pacemaker from the lowest bidder. bargain with your sponsors early in the process when the price issue is not as important for them and asked them to accompany you to the negotiations. The clients commodification strategy here is often to bring in a person who doesn't understand the value of what you're selling. So he or she can play dumb to your selling value. Of course, your sponsor at this point has to be an agent of their organization. But this person can explain the high level values, benefits and reasonable risks associated with this product or solution. Otherwise, you may find yourself arguing over 1000s while trying to save them millions. Product and timing Technical project team evaluations grind away on comparisons of features and capabilities early in the sale. product detail can actually go away at certain times and under certain conditions to show you how product fit can be minimized at the end of the sale. sometimes just prior to signing of a contract the customer will add products or services or solutions sight unseen. Why do they do this when they've spent previous time poring over the details? The answer is trust. They trust that the products based on the ones they had or solutions based on the ones they've evaluated already. If those solutions made sense to them, or worse than anything else must as well they trust you now. They trust you as a company. And if they've met with your executives, if they've come to your office, then they trust you even more and if you have spent time with them than they trust you personally, maybe you have even become friends. In addition, one of the political requirements and evaluation involvement of the project team had already been met by exhausting detail evaluation. It wasn't necessary to make them go through this again. They felt they had been consulted, because one of the strategic things top management's or by having those evaluations is involvement and buying from the project team. Nobody likes to have a system shoved down their throat, but we're already past that phase. Products versus solutions In that regard. positioning your company as a solutions company rather than a product tools company can lower risk, increase trust and shorten sales cycle. Anderson, Deloitte and other major consulting firms don't spend 80% of their time proving product fit like product companies do they sell a solution? They sell results. They'll make it fit and they have a record and resources to prove it. They'll either build it from scratch, integrate someone else's or rebuild yours. The questions changed to what do you want it to look like? To how long will it take and how much would it cost? What to sell when A time-based sales strategy tells the sales team when to sell which issues to whom. In the beginning of an evaluation the client waives certain issues and considers them important but later in the decision-making process the importance can change dramatically. Finally, in the acquisition phase, a whole set of requirements may evolve. The savvy business developer recognizes these changing issues takes advantage of this process and capitalizes on it to shift issues to his or her own strength. The sales rep without a dynamic strategy ends up a perpetual victim. The message is that what worked early in a sale may not work in the end of a sale. Counterattacks opportunities to coast across the land, they have to be pushed, prepare for counter attacks at the end because nothing is more dangerous than a wounded competitor. A competitor that wakes up and realizes they're facing 100% of zero will do things they weren't going to do before. They may raise new issues they may go negative. They may try to go over the product teams head and they may try to smash the products. The good competitive salesperson this point was paid defense as well as offense. They must anticipate these desperation attacks predict them and neutralize them. Early detection allows early correction. Early information is the key to navigating the Death Valley sales cycle, speed and accuracy of information drive speed and accuracy of strategy which drives competitive advantage. If there's bad news, when do you want it as early as possible because then you can either change your strategy or go somewhere else. Once the crucible is passed, and a decision is announced that cement is set, it takes a political jackhammer to change the shape of things now. We said that seeking bad news is not human nature. And doctors agree that the number one prevention of any illnesses early detection, but most salespeople don't ask the tough questions because they don't want to spoil a perfectly good looking forecast.",
